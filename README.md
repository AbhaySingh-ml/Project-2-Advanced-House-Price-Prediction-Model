# 🏠 Advanced House Price Prediction Model

A comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning Regression** project based on the Kaggle dataset *["House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques"](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)*.  

This project aims to understand the underlying data patterns that drive property prices, perform detailed data cleaning and visualization, and build predictive models to estimate house prices accurately.

## 🧩 Project Overview
This project focuses on **understanding and predicting house prices** by analyzing various property attributes such as overall quality, living area, neighborhood, and more.  

The notebook explores data visually and statistically, performs feature correlation analysis, handles missing data, detects outliers, and builds regression models for prediction.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform deep **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand data distribution and relationships.
- Identify key features that influence house prices.
- Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encodings.
- Train regression models and evaluate their performance.
- Present findings through visualizations and summary statistics.

## 📊 Dataset
**Source:** [Kaggle - House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)  
**Size:** 1460 rows × 81 columns  

The dataset includes:
- **Numerical features** (e.g., `GrLivArea`, `LotArea`, `OverallQual`)
- **Categorical features** (e.g., `Neighborhood`, `HouseStyle`)
- **Target variable:** `SalePrice`

---

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**  
   - Handled missing values systematically.  
   - Analyzed feature types and distributions.  
   - Dealt with outliers using IQR and domain logic.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized univariate, bivariate, and multivariate relationships.  
   - Analyzed feature correlations with `SalePrice`.  
   - Identified top features contributing to price prediction.

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Label encoded categorical features.  
   - Scaled numerical data using StandardScaler.  
   - Created derived features for better representation.

4. **Modeling**  
   - Implemented baseline models: Linear Regression, Ridge, and Lasso.  
   - Compared performance using **RMSE** and **R² score**.  
   - Cross-validated models for robustness.

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Visualized predicted vs. actual values.  
   - Interpreted residual errors and model biases.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Heatmap of correlations** to identify key predictors.
- **Boxplots** and **violin plots** for price distribution by category.
- **Pairplots** for visualizing feature interactions.
- Analysis of how `OverallQual`, `GrLivArea`, and `Neighborhood` affect `SalePrice`.

## 🤖 Modeling and Evaluation
| Model | RMSE | R² Score |
|--------|------|----------|
| Linear Regression | 0.137 | 0.89 |
| Ridge Regression | 0.132 | 0.90 |
| Lasso Regression | 0.135 | 0.89 |

*(Note: Values are indicative and depend on random state and data splits.)*

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `SciPy`, `Scikit-learn`  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, GitHub  

---

## 💡 Key Insights
- `OverallQual` and `GrLivArea` are the strongest predictors of `SalePrice`.  
- Year of construction and neighborhood also significantly influence prices.  
- Handling missing values correctly and scaling data improved model stability.  
- Ridge regression performed slightly better than Linear or Lasso due to regularization.

---

## 📈 Results
- Developed a regression pipeline that predicts house prices with high accuracy.  
- Achieved a good generalization score with reduced overfitting.  
- Produced interpretable visual insights useful for real-estate data analytics.

---

## 🚀 Future Work
- Deploy the model using **Streamlit** for interactive price prediction.  
- Experiment with advanced models like **XGBoost** or **LightGBM**.  
- Integrate real-world data sources (e.g., Zillow API) for dynamic prediction.  
- Add hyperparameter tuning and feature selection pipeline.
